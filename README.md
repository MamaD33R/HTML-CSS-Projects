<b>HTML & CSS PROJECTS</b>
This is going to be where I store my different work on HTML/CSS.

Switched from NotePad++ to Visual Studio Code

    <br>
I've made a few websites to example my progress:

  <br>
    <br>
<h3><strong>Movie Theater Website</strong></h3>
  <br>
I created an example movie theater website. There's a lot of simplicity and smooth effects due to using Bootstrap 4 and components like: cards, navbar, jumbotron, form, and dropdowns.

<h3><strong>Treehouse Resort Website</strong></h3>
  <br>
I practiced creating a navbar, image containers, hover effects, and a form.
