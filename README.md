<b>HTML & CSS PROJECTS</b>
This is going to be where I store my different work on HTML/CSS for school!
  <br>
    <br>
Switched from NotePad++ to Visual Studio Code
  <br>
    <br>
I've made a few websites to example my progress:

  <br>

  <br>
    <br>
<strong>Movie Theater Website</strong>
<br>
I practiced creating a navbar, image containers, hover effects, and a form.
